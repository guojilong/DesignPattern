# Facade 外观模式

使用单一的类来封装复杂的系统调用并对外提供接口


| Pattern | Intent  |
| ------ | ------ |
| Adapter |	Converts one interface to another so that it matches what the client is expecting|
| Decorator |	 Dynamically adds responsibility to the |interface by wrapping the original code|
| Facade |	Provides a simplified interface |


The facade pattern is typically used when:

* a simple interface is required to access a complex system;
* the abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled;
* need an entry point to each level of layered software; or
* a system is very complex or difficult to understand.
